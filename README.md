# Breakout Game in Python

This project is a Python implementation of the classic Breakout game, featuring a paddle, a ball, and a set of bricks. The player uses the paddle to hit the ball and destroy bricks, scoring points and progressing through levels. The game is built with Python's Turtle Graphics and Pygame for sound management, offering a simple yet engaging gaming experience.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Move the paddle left and right to bounce the ball and break bricks.
- **Scoring System**: Earn points for each brick you break.
- **Lives System**: Start with a set number of lives. The game ends when all lives are lost.
- **Level Progression**: Each level increases in difficulty with more bricks and faster ball speeds.
- **Sound Effects**: Enjoy gameplay with sound effects for hitting the paddle, breaking bricks, and game events.
